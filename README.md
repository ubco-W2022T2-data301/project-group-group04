Our group will be analyzing the air quality among different locations within the United States and we will each be focusing on specific possible factors effecting the varying AQI levels. There are a large variety of locations outlined in our dataset and we will be narrowing in on locations based off of proximity to large bodies of water, landlocked metro areas, rural, urban, and industrialized areas. With these types of areas we will proceed to analyze any potential correlations that they have with amounts of chemical that are present and are produced from various sources. With this we will be able to further explore and understand if there are any differences in air quality between rural vs urban locations, coastal vs central land locations, and industrialized vs rural. In addition to the findings and correlations we may determine, we would also like to assess any relations between AQI levels and asthma rates.
