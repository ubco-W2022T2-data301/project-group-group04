## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is a combination of annual air quality index summaries sorted by CBSA (provided by EPA AirData, collected automatically, and then aggregated and published by the EPA) and asthma health data from the CDC, about the prevalence of asthma in 2020 and 2019 for 500 US cities. The data is from 2011 to 2022, and is provided in csv format under the public domain copyright exemption for US governmental works. The Air quality data provides data regarding the number of days air quality fell in the categories from "good" to "hazardous", as well as the average AQI for the year. Additionally, it also provides the number of days where certain pollutants, including but limited to CO, NO2, and Ozone were above the national air quality standard. The air concentration dataset includes metrics about different parameters that effect air quality in annual summaries for different CBSAs throughout the US and certain national baselines for acceptable quantities of these parameters. Further, the dataset provides data about average weather conditions in certain locations, and whether or not each monitor location had events that could be classified as "natural disasters" to help know if results might be skewed by any natural phenomena.
