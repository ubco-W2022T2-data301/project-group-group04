## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is a combination of annual air quality index summaries sorted by CBSA (provided by EPA AirData) and asthma health data from the CDC. The data is from 2011 to 2022, and is provided in csv format under the public domain copyright exemption for US governmental works. The Air quality data provides data regarding the number of "good", "moderate", "unhealthy for sensitive groups", "unhealthy", "very unhealthy", and "hazardous" days in a year for every city, as well as the average AQI for the year for those cities. Additionally, it also provides the number of days where certain pollutants, including but limited to CO, NO2, and Ozone were above the national air quality standard.
