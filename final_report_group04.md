# Introduction

As time proceeds, pollution from industries is steadily making the air quality in our atmosphere worse, due to pollutants from manufacturing. As a group, we were interested in how different parameters can effect regional air quality both instantaneously and over time, and also how those parameters can effect asthma prevalence. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

> A summary of the **highlights** of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.

# Questions and Results

## Question 1

> Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.

## Question 2

> Same as above, but for Question 2

# Summary

> A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project.
