# Introduction

<!-- A short paragraph introducing your project to the audience and a motivation for why this project is important. Itâ€™s fine to say your group has an interest in this topic and were keen to explore it more. -->

As time proceeds, pollution from industries is steadily making the air quality in our atmosphere worse, due to pollutants from manufacturing. As a group, we were interested in how different parameters can effect regional air quality both instantaneously and over time, and also how those parameters can effect asthma prevalence. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

<!--  A summary of the **highlights** of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did. --> 

For our exploratory analysis, we mostly focused on wether or not there were any correlations that we were expecting, or not expecting. To do that, one of the things we did was aggregate the different air quality parameters into heatmap, which did indicate that some of the expected correlations are there. Furthermore, a choropleth of AQI by region, and point based asthma prevalence was generated to check if there were any potential trends, or if it was truly random. These plots are shown below:

# Questions and Results

## Question 1

<!--  Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description. -->

Our first research question was how so different chemicals effect air quality ratings, specifically the main hazardous components in fuels for motor vehicles or stoves like natural gas/gasoline/diesel fuels (benzenes, sulfurs/oxides of nitrogens etc), and certain manufacturing wastes, effect AQI, especially over time. Further, based on these particulates, is there a significant difference in air quality change across time in urban vs rural, areas but also generically over time, based on specific particulates in the first part, and if there is any correlations between asthma rates in different areas and the levels of pollutants there for 2020 specifically.

Looking at the [plot of Max AQI against Crude Asthma prevalence](./images/gavin-plot-1.png), there is a relation that can be seen in certain areas between asthma and AQI, in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, and New Mexico. However, looking on the eastern portion of the US, AQI is much lower, but on the states west of the eastern coast states, a band of relatively higher asthma prevalence can be seen, indicating that AQI is a bad predictive index for asthma on it own. Further, AQI tends to be higher on the west coast, due to the more frequent and large wildfire events[^1] on the west coast, especially in 2020[^2], causing sampling bias in the AQI data.

[^1]: [2020 Western US Wildfire Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Western_United_States_wildfire_season) - While Wikipedia is not a primary source, it has aggregated information about the extent of wildfires this year, and more complete information is available on the internet if the reader wishes to go into more detail. The exacts of the wildfires are not important for the data analysis here, just that the AQI is highly sample biased on the west coast for 2020.

[^2]: Given the wildfires and as such sampling bias issues identified, the reader may ask why 2020 was chosen as the year for air quality. The asthma data released by the CDC was only for the year 2020 and as such, the most representative year to compare it to air quality was 2020, other years may have different measurements of other populations which could skew analysis further, and since the main particulates from wildfire smoke (PM2.5, PM10, and $\text{CO}_2$) are not being analyzed here, the wildfires will not effect the analysis very much overall.

Also, the [AQI time delta plot](./images/gavin-plot-3.png) and the [violin plot](./images/gavin-aqi-violinplot.png) show median AQI across time as deltas and absolutes, which shows that over time, there are fluctuations across the country across years, there are small, temporary fluctuations, but overall AQI tends to have stayed fairly steady over time at median[^3] yearly readings, indicating over time AQI has stayed the same in most regions.  

[^3]: Median readings were chosen here over Max AQI to limit the effects of wildfires as discussed above.

Overall, we can find positive correlations between Ozone Levels, Carbon Monoxide, Nitro (NOx) Compounds, with a potential weak correlation with Sulfur Dioxide, an emission from some fuels like diesel and natural gas. Futhermore, There is not a direct correlation between AQI and Crude asthma prevalence in the US, however comparing individual groups of parameters shows that there is a correlation between Ozone, Nitro (NOx) Compounds, and Carbon Monoxide, at least in certain portions of the US (corn and tornado belts/alleys), which show there is not a difference between rural and urban areas necessarily. A final analysis across times showed that AQI does not vary massively across time, at least over the time period investigated, and the minor variations across years are not significant, especially once differences due to wildfire events[^1] have been taken into account.

*Note:* A more in context analysis can be seen in the jupyter notebook from which analysis was done, which can be found [here](./analysis/analysis1.ipynb).

## Question 2
Our second research question, look at the effects of humidity on the air quality, by looking at the AQI and the level of CO, CO2, NO2, and other airborne molecules and particulates at different humidity levels. This is done by seperation the data into dry and humid areas, and then looking at the distribution of the pollutants in each area. This is achieved by splitting each CBSA zone into 3 categories using average relative humidity: Dry (relative humidity < 40), Moderate (40 <= relative humidity <= 60), and Humid (relative humidity > 60).

When looking at the [ridge plot for pollutants](./images/skyridge1.png) at different humidity levels, no particular correlation between dry and humid areas can be observed, aside from a few outliers like Antimony being more concentrated in dry areas and Barium being less concentrated in humid areas.

Moving on from the analysis of gaseous molecules and particulate matter, the correlation between median AQI (the median is used to prevent outliers from skewing the results) and relative humidity is also analyzed. Overall, it can be observed from the [ridge plot for AQI over year](./images/skyridge2.png) that the median AQI tends to form a bimodal distribution with one mode around 40 - 60 and the other around 80 - 100. Generally, very few humid areas are found in the second mode. This means, on average, humid regions have lower median AQI than dry regions. Additionally, the second mode for dry areas was centered around an AQI of 120 from 2020 to 2021, which may be due to the recent forest fires in the western US[^1]. This may be the reason why the [scatter plot](./images/skyscatter.png) of median AQI over relative humidity (all years) shows a slight correlation between the two parameters, however, this correlation is not strong enough to be considered significant.

# Summary

<!-- A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project. -->

Overall, connections between certain parameters, including but not limited to  carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitro (NOx) compounds do have relatively strong effects on AQI, and a subset of those parameters appear to effect asthma prevalence. Furthermore, across the last 10 years, there have been no statistically significant changes in regional air quality[^1] [^4]. Additionally, it appears that there is not a statically significant correlation between most pollutants and relative humidity overall. However, it is worth noting that this observation may be influenced by extreme outliers. Additionally, aggregate metrics such as median AQI showed a correlation with high relative humidity during certain years, namely 2020 and 2021, but it is unclear what causes this relationship. Possible explanations include recent forest fires[^1] or differences in the surrounding air quality between dry and humid areas, but more data would be needed to support these hypotheses. Further investigation is required to confirm these findings.

[^4]: While there are some small changes in median AQI across years, it is not enough to be considered significant. See [this](./images/gavin-aqi-violinplot.png) plot.
