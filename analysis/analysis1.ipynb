    "\n",
    "**My main interest is how different chemicals effect air quality ratings, beyond just the generic 'PM2.5'/'PM 10'/CO2/NO(x), like heavy metals or residuals in traditional fuels for motor vehicles or stoves like natural gas/gasoline/diesel fuels, and also potentially common organic solvents that are used in manufacturing (i.e. toluene), and how these different particulates effect AQI. Further, I want to see if there is a significant difference in air quality change across time in urban vs rural areas (not just if urban areas have better/worse air quality), based on specific particulates in the first part, and if there is any correlations between asthma rates in different areas and the levels of pollutants there.**\n",

    "### Rough Plan for Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Already done as part of loading) Combine all EPA data files into one dataframe\n",
    "2. Remove rows for data thats not applicable, i.e. sample data, wind speed, precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, etc\n",
    "3. Remove columns that are mostly null/na/nan/missing values or are not interesting to the analysis\n",
    "3. Remove rows for data thats not adjusted/corrected to be aligned with the rest of the data\n",
    "5. Remove rows for data with too few data points to be useable for analysis, probably less  than a few hundred/thousand, or rows that contain data thats unique to one city (unique to once city could be used for a time based analysis for a single city, but thats more specific than i'm interested)\n",
    "6. From the remaining parameters, narrow in to the top 10 to 25(?) parameters to analyze\n",
    "7. Try to see if there are any obvious correlations via heatmap(s)/basic plots/basic statistical analysis\n",
    "8. From there, try and find out where the real and observable correlations are to then visualize\n",
    "9. Unknown as of now"
